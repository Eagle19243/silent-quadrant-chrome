## What is Silent Quadrant Password Protection?

Silent Quadrant Password Protection is a Chrome extension that you can drop into any web page which dramatically improves the security of users accessing your website.

Silent Quadrant Password Protection works by binding itself to all `input` elements on the page of type
`email` or `password`. Whenever a user enters a new value into one of these
`input` elements, Silent Quadrant Password Protection will check the user's email / password against
the fabulous [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com) API service to see whether or not
the user's email OR password has been breached in the past.

Finally, if appropriate, Silent Quadrant Password Protectionwill inform the user that their credentials
were previously breached, give them some useful information, and ask them to
update their password as soon as they can to reduce the risk that their account
will be compromised.

Silent Quadrant Password Protection is a new, experimental way to proactively notify users about data
breaches and help casual web users play a more active role in protecting their
online accounts.

We believe that by informing and guiding users to reset their credentials when
necessary, we can all help make the web a safer place &lt;3
